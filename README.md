# Understand and explain impacts to life expectancy in different regions of the world based on:
* Income
    * How has income profile changed over time by region? 
    * Is there an observable relationship between income and life expectancy in aggregate?  At the regional level?  
* Population 
    * Has population grown/shrank/stayed the same?
    * Is there an observable relationship between population and life expectancy in aggregate?  At the regional level?  
* Fertility rates 
     * How has fertility changed over time by region? 
     * Is there an observable relationship between fertility rates and life expectancy in aggregate?  At the regional level?  

# Initial hypothesis:  If income is increasing, life expectancy will increase 
# Additionally: of the variables we studied, income will have the highest correlation to life expectancy 
# Summary conclusion: Yes, increasing income leads to increased life expectancy in all regions, but it is not universally the most      significant factor, fertility was.
